I am a student at the University of Toronto, double major in Mathematical Sciences and Statistics (Applied). I work patiently, consciously, efficiently, and leave no stone unturned on all tasks assigned in school and at work. With my specialized areas learned at the university, mathematics and statistics. I have a strong passion for honing my data visualization skills. I always integrate and handle work with logic perpetually. Also, always seeking multiple ways to solve problems along with innovation. Additionally, being a native Mandarin speaker and fluent in English, I leverage this advantage to facilitate communication for those less familiar with the language.
